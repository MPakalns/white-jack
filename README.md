# White Jack

## Description

Welcome to a modified version of the classic game 'Black Jack' called 'White Jack'!
In this version of Black Jack each player plays against the others, not the dealer.

The game itself should be played in person with real cards, real chips, and real people. 
It is meant to serve as a calculator and game organization software to help calculate winnings and detect rule-breaking.

## Installation

There are two ways to install:
  1) Add the files to a Visual Studio project (or any other IDE that supports C++ compilation) and run it.
  2) Compile and link the files manually.
